## My Solution
The source code of the application mentioned in this git repo is my approach for solution.
It implements Brownian motion on a robot in a square arena using Pygame for visualization.The module used here is pygame.This code defines the size of the arena and the robot, as well as the initial position, direction, speed, and time step of the robot. It also defines the colors of the arena and the robot, as well as the duration of rotation and the maximum angle of random deviation.

The main loop of the simulation moves the robot in the set direction, checks for collisions, and randomly changes the direction. It also clears the screen and draws the arena and the robot, updates the display.

## Installation of the application
If Pygame is not installed on your system,you can install Pygame using pip, a package manager for Python, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
### Command
pip install pygame

If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before running the command. Once Pygame is installed, you should be able to run the code without any issues.

Next pull this git repo and run the application.
